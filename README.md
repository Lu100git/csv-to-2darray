# csv-to-2darray
this is a simple tool to convert csv files into a file with a 2d array in it
using zenity for Linux distros, so far, this script works on Debian 12,

The main porpuse of this tool is to convert CSV files that Tiled export when creating tile maps
I was originally doing it in the terminal, but I want to share this tool, to the Linux comunity
specially the game dev comunity
